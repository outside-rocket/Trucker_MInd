# Real-Time Vehicle Detection System

## Overview
This project focuses on **real-time vehicle detection** using advanced computer vision techniques. By leveraging **OpenCV** and a pre-trained **SSD MobileNet** model, we developed a system that captures video from a camera, detects various vehicle types, and visually highlights them on the screen. The application aims to enhance **traffic monitoring** and provide valuable insights into vehicle flow in urban environments.

## Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Utilizes computer vision to identify and track vehicles in live video feeds.
- **Multi-class Recognition**: Capable of recognizing various vehicle classes, including:
  - **Cars**
  - **Trucks**
  - **Buses**
  - **Motorcycles**
  - **Bicycles**
  - **Vans**
- **Confidence Levels**: Displays confidence levels for each detected vehicle, enhancing the reliability of detections.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Aims to contribute to smarter transportation solutions through innovative technology.
